# React Components, Hooks, Konva.js Live Cursor Collaboration, and Netlify Deployment

This project demonstrates the integration of React components, React hooks, Konva.js for live collaborative cursor interaction, and deployment using Netlify.

## React Components

React components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable, independent pieces of UI that manage their own state and can be composed together to create complex UIs.

In this project, we use React components to create various UI elements such as buttons, input fields, and interactive widgets.

## React Hooks

React hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. They enable you to add stateful logic to functional components.

We leverage React hooks like useState and useEffect in this project to manage component state and perform side effects.

## Konva.js Live Cursor Collaboration

Konva.js is an HTML5 2d canvas library that enables high-performance drawing and interaction on the web. In this project, we use Konva.js to create a canvas for live cursor collaboration.

With Konva.js, multiple users can collaborate in real-time by drawing on the canvas, and their cursors are synchronized across all clients.

## Netlify Deployment

Netlify is a cloud computing company that offers hosting and serverless backend services for web applications. It provides a simple and intuitive platform for deploying static websites and web applications.

To deploy this project with Netlify, simply push your code to a Git repository and connect it to Netlify. Netlify will automatically build and deploy your application whenever you push changes to the repository.

### Deployment Steps:

1. Sign up for a Netlify account if you haven't already.
2. Connect your project repository to Netlify.
3. Configure build settings (e.g., npm install, npm run build).
4. Deploy your project to Netlify.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
